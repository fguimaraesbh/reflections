When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?
- When I wanto to share the repository.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git 
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
- This way we can keep our local version stable until we decide to pull changes.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. 
When would you use one instead of another.
- Fork: copy of another repository. Can be changed without changing the original.
  Clone: copy from remote to local. Used to work localy.
  Branch: parallel version of files. Used when you need more than one version
at the same time.
