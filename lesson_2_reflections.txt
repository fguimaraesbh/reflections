What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
- The metadata directory is created to store the history information about the
tracked files.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
- The staging area groups the files that changed, and alows me to organize my 
commits.
